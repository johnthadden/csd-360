       <h1>My Journey to Software</h1>

       <p> Recently I was still employed for Chipotle Mexican Grill. I had been
working as a General Manager for the company for 3 years. I was told repeatedly
that <span id = "lie1"> _________</span>. If it's not obvious, part of the reason I left is
because I didn't receive that promotion!
</p>

       <p> My former boss had also told me multiple times that<span id = "lie2">
______________________________ </span>. Upon being told that someone else got the promotion
and not I, he also was keen to tell me that 'we knew this would happen since [I] was not yet a
certified training restaurant.'</p>

       <p>After I made my decision to exit, I had to wait around until my annual bonus was deposited. 
       If I would've given notice before that, they would've denied me that bonus the way they've denied
       it to managers in the past who've put in notice that overlapped with a bonus payout. So, every time
       after the promotion I didn't get that they asked me how I was doing and if I still felt good, I would
       let them know <span id = "lie3"> _______________________</span>.</p>
       
       <p>That completes my journey out of Chipotle and into software!</p>
